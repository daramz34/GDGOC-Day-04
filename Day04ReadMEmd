GDGOC Bowen 30-Day Challenge - Dynamic Routes with FastAPI


Implement dynamic routes using path parameters to handle specific resources based on ID.

## What I Built
- Static route: `GET /` - Welcome message
- Dynamic route: `GET /user/{user_id}` - Returns user ID from URL


## Tech Stack
- Python
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn

The one personal issue i had was this =
"http://127.0.0.1:8000/user/dara" instead of me to run this in my url
i ran 
"http://127.0.0.1:8000/about/user/dara"
